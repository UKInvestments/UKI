Invest in me and the futur



Hello all ,

So I introduce myself a little bit, I will try to make it short:

Nicolai Emerenko 30 years old in next April héhéhé ,
Private trader for 4 years, and specified in cryptocurrencies for 2 years now.
 I have always had predispositions for graphical analysis and statistics of all kinds. 

Before the financial markets I set my sights on sports'bet and horse racing with a profit ratio more than correct. But hazard's share still remained too large. 
The classic financial markets assure me the stability for small "safe" profits and the cryptos markets say more "speculative" allow beautiful values.

Fan of new technologies, of the finance world and very active in the crypto-sphere I embarked on this new project.

UK Investments : 

- Why a supply of 5,000,000? 

- With an introductory price of $ 0.01 per token, 
 that makes a sum of $ 50,000 
 Which represents my current personal capital working on the financial markets. 
On one it allows me to ensure the viability of the buyback in all cases and two it makes a small supply so that the ROUNDS does not last that long. 

- What is the use of this token? 

- Quite simply to identify my investments and be able to redistribute the profits afterwards. Thanks to the exchange of tokens I would increase my capital thus being able to secure my biggest positions but also to open new ones to ensure the diversity of the assets and to counter possible news with big impacts.

- Concretely why invest in your token?
 
- This project aims to enhance investors in cryptocurrencies.
 I necessarily ensure a value when redeeming the tokens. 
All holders / stakers will have their distribution of profits.
 I cannot give figures or false hope but it would necessarily be positive!
